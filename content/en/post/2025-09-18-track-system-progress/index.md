After several weeks of mechanical iteration, the team has completed the initial assembly of HORU's track system. This milestone enables progression to motor calibration and traction testing on different surface types.

Next evaluation items:

1. Chain alignment and tension.
2. Power consumption under varying loads.
3. Control patterns to improve maneuverability on irregular terrain.

Immediate next steps:
- Integrate inertial sensors to refine speed control loops.
- Thermal validation of motors during extended sessions.
- Record performance metrics for future design iterations.

If you want to contribute to this phase or suggest test ideas, reach out or join a work session.
